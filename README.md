## � What I'm About

I'm a DevSecOps engineer who's obsessed with making infrastructure secure by default and operations boring (in a good way). When I'm not automating away repetitive tasks, you'll find me mentoring teams on security best practices or tinkering with new tools in the cloud native ecosystem.

**Currently working on:** Leading a DevOps team, building security into every step of our CI/CD pipelines, and helping developers ship faster without compromising on security.

## 💻 Things I Love Working With

- ☁️ Building scalable infrastructure on **AWS & Azure**
- 🔐 Embedding security into CI/CD pipelines (DevSecOps FTW!)
- 🤖 Automating everything with **Jenkins**, **Terraform**, and lots of scripts
- 📊 Creating dashboards that actually help teams catch issues before users do
- 🛠️ Writing Infrastructure as Code because clicking in consoles is so 2015
